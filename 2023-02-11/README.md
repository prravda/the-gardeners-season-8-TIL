# Discord bot client application

I recently started to figure out how Discord bot client works. I used the reference repository, which was implemented using TypeScript and a more abstracted way (e.g. using `Client` of `discord.js`).

I created plans step-by-step:

1. Analyze the reference code
2. Implement a simple feature, such as `/echo`
3. Retrospect the process and create a plan to implement the next feature
4. Find answers to my questions that arose during implementation

I wrote down the whole process [here](https://www.notion.so/Discord-bot-86b42dd608b2407491b7fd363cf33103).

# What I learned

What I learned is to focus on the impact I can give to my application users. My goal is to create meaningful features and solve their problems. I must not forget this goal, even when I'm absorbed in analyzing the reference code.

# MISC

I wrote this with the help of [Notion.ai](https://notion.ai/).
