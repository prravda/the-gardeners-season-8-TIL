I learned the importance of detailed documentation while creating a Discord bot client application. This project involved using a newer API, TypeScript, and a better structure. I had to document the structure, configuration, and how to run the application.

Additionally, I found a book that looks interesting, [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-MIT-Press/dp/0262162091).
