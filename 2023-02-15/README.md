- Analyzed a website to getting information
- In this progress, I knew a library which name is `fingerprintjs`.
  - It make to distinguish and detect a people using a value made by mixing various values.
- Finally I made a decision using headless browser to getting information from this website. Because I can not spend a much of time to implement this feature.
